# Why stepping occurs before the textbook says it should

**Compensatory stepping frequently initiates when the extrapolated center of mass (xCOM) remains well within the base of support (BOS), contradicting the classical margin of stability threshold model.** This observation, which you have found in your own EMG and perturbation data, is strongly supported by over two decades of converging evidence from multiple labs. The simple rule—stepping is triggered when xCOM exceeds BOS—captures only a fraction of the variance in stepping behavior. Pai et al. (2000, *Journal of Biomechanics*) demonstrated that a static COM-within-BOS model predicted just **11% of stepping responses**, while Maki, McIlroy, and Fernie (2003, *IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine*) showed that stepping is "commonly initiated very early, with the COM well within the stability limits." The field has moved decisively toward multi-factorial models incorporating COM velocity, neural prediction, cortical error detection, and psychological state as co-determinants of stepping initiation.

## The classical framework: Hof's margin of stability

The margin of stability (MOS) concept originates in Hof, Gazendam, and Sinke (2005, *Journal of Biomechanics*, 38:1–8), who extended the static stability criterion to dynamic situations using the inverted pendulum model. They defined the extrapolated center of mass as **xCOM = x_COM + ẋ_COM / ω₀**, where ω₀ = √(g/l) is the pendulum eigenfrequency (~3.13 rad/s for a typical adult). The margin of stability is then **MOS = BOS_boundary − xCOM**. When MOS is positive, the system can theoretically decelerate without changing support; when MOS becomes negative, a step, grasp, or external force is required.

Hof (2008, *Human Movement Science*, 27:112–125) extended this to walking control, showing that stable gait could be achieved by placing each foot at a constant offset beyond the xCOM at contact—the "constant offset control" rule. The mediolateral margin between average center of pressure (COP) and xCOM at foot contact was remarkably small: just **1.6 ± 0.7 cm** in healthy walkers. Independently, Pratt, Carff, Drakunov, and Goswami (2006, *IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Robots*) derived the mathematically identical "capture point" concept for bipedal robotics, reinforcing the theoretical elegance of the xCOM framework.

The parallel contribution from Pai and Patton (1997, *Journal of Biomechanics*, 30:347–354) was the **feasible stability region (FSR)**—the set of COM velocity-position combinations from which balance can be recovered without stepping. This explicitly showed that balance control operates in a two-dimensional state space (position × velocity), not the one-dimensional position space implied by a simple BOS boundary. Their upper feasibility boundary ranged from a normalized velocity of 1.1 s⁻¹ at 2.4 foot-lengths behind the heel to zero velocity over the toe, establishing that higher COM velocity shrinks the recoverable region even when COM position is well within BOS.

## Stepping routinely occurs within the base of support

The most direct challenge to the xCOM-BOS threshold model comes from the Toronto/Sunnybrook program of Maki and McIlroy. In their landmark review, Maki and McIlroy (1997, *Physical Therapy*, 77:488–507) established that change-in-support reactions (stepping and grasping) are "**not just strategies of last resort, but are often initiated well before the center of mass is near the stability limits.**" When stance was unconstrained, subjects consistently preferred stepping over fixed-support hip or ankle strategies. McIlroy and Maki (1993, *Brain Research*, 616:30–38) showed that when foot movement was permitted, stepping was the predominant response even at moderate perturbation magnitudes—and when instructed to keep feet in place, subjects could maintain balance, proving the step was not mechanically necessary.

Quantitative evidence is striking. Pai, Maki, Iqbal, McIlroy, and Perry (2000, *Journal of Biomechanics*, 33:387–392) directly compared static versus dynamic COM models for predicting stepping during platform translations. The static model (COM position relative to BOS alone) correctly predicted only **11% of stepping responses**, meaning that **89% of steps occurred with COM still within physical BOS boundaries**. The dynamic model incorporating COM velocity raised prediction accuracy to 71%—better, but still leaving nearly a third of stepping unexplained by purely mechanical variables.

Mille, Rogers, Martinez, Hedman, Johnson, Lord, and Fitzpatrick (2003, *Journal of Neurophysiology*, 90:666–674) mapped the stepping threshold as a function of perturbation velocity during forward waist-pulls. They found a sigmoidal relationship: as perturbation velocity increased, the position threshold for stepping shifted progressively further from the BOS boundary—meaning **faster perturbations triggered stepping when COM was further from the edge**. Critically, the Pai and Patton dynamic model "consistently underestimated how far in front of the ankles the experimentally derived threshold was," and this discrepancy grew with velocity, indicating that even the velocity-position FSR boundary is too conservative.

Perhaps the most revealing refinement came from Hof himself. Hof and Curtze (2016, *Journal of Biomechanics*, 49:580–585) demonstrated that the **effective base of support (eBOS) comprises only about 30% of the physical BOS area** during sudden perturbations. Because the COP cannot instantaneously reach the BOS boundary—it requires finite reaction time and muscle force development—the actual stability margin is far smaller than MOS calculated from anatomical BOS boundaries suggests. In one backward-fall trial, the physical MOS appeared to be 50 mm, but the effective margin was only ~8 mm. This single finding substantially reconciles the discrepancy your data likely shows: participants are stepping because the functional stability boundary is much closer than the physical foot boundary implies.

## The MOS paradox and why averages mislead

A persistent problem in the literature is the "MOS paradox," formally characterized by McAndrew Young, Wilken, and Dingwell (2012, *Journal of Biomechanics*, 45:1053–1059) and later by Patil, Dingwell, and Cusumano (2022, *Journal of Biomechanics*). Populations at higher fall risk—older adults, amputees, stroke survivors—consistently exhibit **larger mean MOS values** during walking, paradoxically appearing more stable by this metric. Patil et al. resolved this by showing that averaging MOS across steps discards step-to-step dynamics; people do not fall "on average" but from singular destabilizing events. They proposed a "Probability of Instability" metric that correctly captured increased instability risk (p = 9.45 × 10⁻³⁴) even as average MOS increased. Curtze, Buurke, and McCrum (2024, *Journal of Biomechanics*, 166:112045) provided a comprehensive critical perspective emphasizing that **MOS is a measure of instantaneous mechanical configuration, not of overall stability or fall risk**, and noted that Hof originally did not intend MOS for anteroposterior assessment during continuous walking, where xCOM perpetually exceeds the anterior BOS boundary.

## Alternative mechanisms that trigger stepping

### COM velocity and acceleration dominate over position

The evidence converges on COM velocity as the primary mechanical variable driving stepping decisions, with acceleration providing additional predictive power. Hasson, Van Emmerik, and Caldwell (2008, *Journal of Biomechanics*) showed that incorporating COM acceleration into time-to-contact (TtC) calculations significantly improved stepping predictions and provided earlier warning than position or velocity alone. TtC minima occurred earlier with acceleration inclusion, suggesting the CNS uses rate-of-change information to anticipate boundary crossing. Forbes et al. (2024, *Journal of Neurophysiology*) demonstrated that proprioceptive reweighting during balance control is driven primarily by **stimulus velocity rather than amplitude**, indicating velocity-based sensory signals are the dominant inputs for balance decisions.

Inkol and Vallis (2019, *Journal of Biomechanics*, 95:109302) provided a particularly important finding for perturbation researchers: the standard Hof xCOM model returned negative MOS values (predicting stepping) in trials where **no stepping occurred**, and could also fail to predict actual stepping. Their improved model incorporating platform acceleration waveforms corrected these errors, demonstrating that perturbation dynamics not captured by the simple inverted pendulum substantially affect the xCOM-BOS relationship.

### Cortical error detection and predictive monitoring

Neurophysiological evidence reveals a cortical monitoring system that contributes to stepping decisions independently of mechanical thresholds. Payne and Ting (2020, Emory University/Georgia Tech) identified the cortical N1 response (~100–200 ms post-perturbation, localized to supplementary motor area) as an error detection signal that is **larger when a corrective step is required** and scales with perturbation intensity. Solis-Escalante, Stokkermans, Grillner, and Wessberg (2021, *European Journal of Neuroscience*) confirmed that both N1 amplitude and midfrontal theta power predict stepping versus feet-in-place outcomes, providing direct evidence of cortical contributions to the stepping decision. Their subsequent work (Solis-Escalante et al., 2023, *Cerebral Cortex*) showed theta dynamics scale with postural threat even when manipulating leaning posture rather than perturbation magnitude.

This cortical involvement explains a key phenomenon: Maki, McIlroy, and Fernie (2003) noted that "the stepping reaction is typically initiated well before the full influence of the perturbation on COM motion has taken effect." The CNS does not wait for xCOM to reach BOS—it **predicts** future instability using forward models and initiates stepping preemptively.

### Stepping as a decision, not a reflex

Rogers, Hedman, Johnson, Martinez, and Mille (2003, *Cognitive Brain Research*, 16:192–198) provided perhaps the most conceptually important reframing: step initiation timing "does not reflect entirely an immediate necessity or last resort response to balance instability determined directly by specific sensory input, but rather **a decision to step**." Older individuals stepped ~130 ms earlier than young adults when balance stability was uncertain, suggesting a pre-selected stepping strategy triggered by non-specific event detection rather than specific COM state information. This decision-based framework explains why:

- **First-trial effects** are so powerful—subjects almost universally step to novel perturbations regardless of magnitude (McIlroy & Maki, 1993)
- **Fear of falling** independently lowers stepping thresholds, as Batcir et al. (2021, *PubMed: 34732659*) showed that greater FES-I scores predicted failure to recover with a single step at lower perturbation levels
- **Cognitive load** delays stepping and reduces step quality (Patel & Bhatt, 2015; Brauer, Woollacott, & Shumway-Cook, 2002), revealing shared attentional resources between balance and cognition
- **Startle responses** can accelerate stepping independent of mechanical state, as reviewed by Nonnekes, Carpenter, Inglis, Duysens, and Weerdesteyn (2015, *Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews*)

### Subcortical EMG timing precedes threshold crossing

For your EMG work specifically: automatic postural responses driven by subcortical brainstem circuits activate at **~100 ms post-perturbation** (Welch & Ting, 2008, 2009), well before xCOM would typically reach BOS boundaries. Torres-Oviedo and Ting (2007) showed these muscle synergy patterns are direction-specific and hardwired, reflecting motor programs triggered by sensory detection of perturbation onset (acceleration and velocity signals) rather than positional threshold crossing. The early EMG activity in stepping-leg muscles (particularly tibialis anterior at 100–300 ms) that you may be observing represents this subcortical initiation of the stepping program before the biomechanical "necessity" criterion is met.

## Age, training, and individual variability reshape stepping thresholds

The stepping threshold is not fixed but is modulated by age, experience, and training. McIlroy and Maki (1996, *Journals of Gerontology*, 51A:M289–M296) found that older adults (65–81 years) stepped significantly more frequently than young adults at identical perturbation magnitudes, with multiple-step responses far more common. Patton, Hilliard, Martinez, Iqbal, and Rogers (2006, IEEE) quantified this: at the lowest perturbation level, older fallers stepped in **52% of trials**, non-fallers in 17.3%, and young adults in just 2.7%. Sturnieks et al. (2013, *PLoS ONE*, 8:e70981) showed in 242 older adults that lower force thresholds for stepping predicted future falls—those with lower posterior force thresholds were **68% more likely to fall at home**.

Perturbation-based balance training (PBT) can recalibrate these thresholds. Van Wouwe et al. (2021, *Frontiers in Sports and Active Living*, 3:714555) demonstrated that PBT reduced stepping incidence by **changing the sensorimotor transformation** from xCOM state to motor response, rather than altering the xCOM-BOS relationship itself. Pai et al. (2014, *Journals of Gerontology Series A*, 69:1586–1594) showed a single session of 24 repeated slips reduced annual fall risk by 50%. McCrum, Karamanidis, and colleagues (2018, *Communications Biology*, 1:230) demonstrated full retention of reactive gait adaptations over one month, with interlimb transfer. These findings collectively indicate that the stepping "threshold" is a modifiable neural policy, not a fixed biomechanical boundary.

## Practical implications for your perturbation research

Your finding that stepping occurs with xCOM within BOS is entirely consistent with the literature. Five specific considerations for interpreting your data:

- **Measure effective BOS, not physical BOS.** Following Hof and Curtze (2016), the functional stability boundary is roughly 30% of the anatomical BOS. Recalculating MOS relative to the COP excursion limits under maximum voluntary effort may better predict stepping in your data.
- **Examine COM velocity at step initiation.** Plot your data in Pai and Patton's COM position-velocity state space. The FSR boundary, not the BOS boundary, is the more appropriate threshold for stepping prediction.
- **Analyze EMG onset relative to xCOM trajectory.** If stepping-related muscle activation begins at 100–150 ms (subcortical latency) while xCOM does not reach BOS until later, this temporal dissociation confirms predictive rather than reactive stepping initiation.
- **Control for trial order and habituation.** First-trial stepping rates are dramatically higher than subsequent trials (McIlroy & Maki, 1993). If your protocol includes novel perturbations, early trials will show "unnecessary" stepping driven by startle and uncertainty.
- **Consider individual psychological state.** Fear of falling and anxiety independently lower stepping thresholds. If your participants vary in balance confidence, this may explain inter-individual variability in stepping occurrence at identical xCOM-BOS margins.

## Conclusion

The xCOM-BOS framework remains a valuable mechanical descriptor of instantaneous postural configuration, but it is insufficient as a sole predictor of stepping initiation. The field has converged on a model where stepping is a **neural decision** shaped by at least four interacting layers: the COM velocity-position state relative to feasibility boundaries (not just BOS boundaries); predictive cortical monitoring indexed by N1 and theta dynamics; descending modulation from threat perception, attention, and prior experience; and subcortical motor programs triggered by perturbation onset dynamics rather than positional thresholds. The effective BOS being only ~30% of physical BOS (Hof & Curtze, 2016) further means that what appears to be stepping "within BOS" may actually represent stepping near the true functional boundary. Your EMG data showing stepping before xCOM exceeds BOS adds to a well-established body of evidence that the classical threshold model, while theoretically elegant, captures only a fraction of the complex sensorimotor decision-making underlying human balance recovery.
